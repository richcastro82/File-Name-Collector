# File Name Collector
 This a tiny appilcation that will take all the files within a given directory and creates a csv file listing all the file names in the directory. 
 
 #Why did I create this application? 
 Had a client that wanted a list of the files in their DropBox and rather than spend 2 weeks logging each file name, I spent 15 minutes creating this app to do the work for me.
